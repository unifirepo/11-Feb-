  {
    question: 'Do all UK schools need a Climate Action Plan?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The Department for Education expects every education setting in England — including maintained schools, academies, multi-academy trusts, independent schools, special schools, and early years settings — to appoint a sustainability lead and publish a Climate Action Plan. While not yet statutory, this is a firm government expectation with progress reporting from 2025 onwards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between maintained schools and academies for carbon reporting?',
    answer:
      'Maintained schools are overseen by their local authority, which may hold estate-wide energy data and support sustainability planning. Academies and free schools operate as independent charitable trusts, so they typically own their own reporting — though many belong to a multi-academy trust that coordinates carbon data centrally. TrackZero works for both single-site schools and trust-wide roll-ups.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do independent schools need to comply with DfE climate requirements?',
    answer:
      "Yes. The DfE's Sustainability and Climate Change Strategy applies to all education settings, and independent schools are regulated by the department. They are expected to appoint a sustainability lead and maintain a Climate Action Plan covering decarbonisation, adaptation, biodiversity, and climate education — the same core pillars as state-funded schools.",
  },
  {
    question: 'When do academy trusts need SECR reporting?',
    answer:
      'Large multi-academy trusts that meet two or more SECR size thresholds — over 250 employees, turnover above £36 million, or a balance sheet total above £18 million — must include energy use and carbon disclosures in their annual trustees’ report. Trusts consuming more than 40,000 kWh of UK energy must report; smaller trusts can state why disclosures are omitted.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What emissions should schools measure?',
    answer:
      'Most schools start with Scope 1 and 2 emissions from gas heating, purchased electricity, and school transport fuel. Scope 3 covers procurement, catering, waste, staff commuting, and school trips — often the largest share. The DfE recommends using UK Government conversion factors and standards such as the GHG Protocol. TrackZero guides you through each scope with school-relevant categories and emissions-per-pupil intensity ratios.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can TrackZero support multi-academy trusts with many schools?',
    answer:
      'Yes. TrackZero lets MATs collect emissions data across individual sites, calculate trust-wide totals, and produce consolidated reports for trustees, governors, and SECR disclosures. Sustainability leads can monitor progress at both school and trust level, set shared reduction targets, and engage staff and students with clear, accessible dashboards.',
