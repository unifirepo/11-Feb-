              Universities face a unique set of challenges when it comes to energy management. With large, complex campuses, diverse building types, and fluctuating occupancy patterns, identifying and reducing energy waste can be a daunting task.

            <H2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Challenge</H2>
            <Body className="mb-6">
              A leading UK university was struggling with rising energy costs and a lack of visibility into building performance. Their existing systems were fragmented, and they had no way of correlating energy spend with actual building usage.
            </Body>

            <H2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Solution: Cortex™</H2>
            <Body className="mb-6">
              The university partnered with Unifi.id to implement the Cortex™ platform across their main campus. By integrating real-time occupancy data with their existing energy monitoring systems, we were able to provide a clear, zone-by-zone view of energy waste.

              "Cortex™ provided us with the visibility we had been missing. By understanding how our buildings were actually being used, we were able to identify and eliminate significant energy waste."

            <H2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Results</H2>
            <Body className="mb-6">
              Within the first six months of implementation, the university achieved:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3 text-gray-700">
              <li>**30% reduction in total energy costs** through occupancy-led HVAC and lighting control.</li>
              <li>**Verifiable carbon footprint reduction** for annual ESG reporting.</li>
              <li>**Improved occupant comfort and safety** through real-time environmental monitoring.</li>
              <li>**Data-led capital planning** for future building upgrades.</li>
