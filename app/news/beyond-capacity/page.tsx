              For venue managers, the challenge of capacity management is constant. Whether it's a stadium, a nightclub, or a corporate event space, knowing exactly how many people are in the building - and where they are concentrated - is essential for safety, compliance, and operational efficiency.

            <Body className="mb-6">
              Overcrowding isn't just uncomfortable for guests; it's a major safety hazard. It can lead to crushing, blocked exits, and delayed emergency responses. Furthermore, exceeding your licensed capacity can result in heavy fines, legal action, and the loss of your operating license.

              In the modern venue environment, "good enough" is no longer acceptable when it comes to capacity management.
