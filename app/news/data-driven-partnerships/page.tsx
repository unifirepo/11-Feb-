              In the world of smart buildings, the "rip and replace" approach is often costly, disruptive, and unnecessary. At Unifi.id, we believe in a different approach: **integration**. Our platform is designed to work with your existing infrastructure, making it smarter and more effective through the power of data.

            <Body className="mb-6">
              Most buildings already have a significant investment in security, fire safety, and energy management systems. However, these systems are often "dumb" - they collect data but don't provide actionable intelligence. Unifi.id's Cortex™ platform acts as an intelligence layer, integrating with these legacy systems to provide real-time visibility and control.

              We partner with leading technology providers across the building management spectrum to ensure our platform works seamlessly with the tools you already use. Whether it's access control, fire safety, or energy monitoring, our data-driven partnerships make every system in your building better.

              The future of smart buildings is not about individual devices; it's about how those devices work together. By focusing on integration and data-driven partnerships, Unifi.id is helping building managers create smarter, safer, and more efficient environments without the need for costly "rip and replace" projects.
