              Fire safety compliance is often viewed as a series of periodic checks: the annual inspection, the monthly alarm test, the weekly fire door check. While these are essential, they only provide a snapshot of a building's safety at a specific moment in time.

            <Body className="mb-6">
              In the intervals between these checks, a building's fire safety status can change significantly. A fire door can be propped open, an alarm sensor can fail, or a new hazard can be introduced. Without continuous monitoring, these issues can go undetected until it's too late.

            <Body className="mb-12">
              In the modern regulatory environment, "good enough" is no longer acceptable when it comes to fire safety. By embracing living fire system intelligence, building managers can move beyond the annual certificate and provide a higher standard of protection for their occupants and their business.
