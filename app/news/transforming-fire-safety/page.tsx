                        Fire drills and evacuation protocols are often treated as tick-box exercises - necessary but not always effective. In reality, emergencies demand live data and instant insight.

              When a fire alarm sounds in a large commercial building, the primary goal is simple: get everyone out safely. However, the execution of this goal is often hampered by a lack of information. Who is still in the building? Where are they? Are they moving toward an exit?

            <Body className="mb-6">
              Traditional fire safety relies heavily on static plans and periodic drills. While these are important, they don't account for the dynamic nature of a real emergency. A building's occupancy changes by the minute, and a fire can block planned evacuation routes, rendering static plans useless.

              Unifi.id's FireGuard™ solution introduces real-time evacuation intelligence. By using presence detection technology, we provide fire safety leads and emergency responders with a live view of building occupancy during an alarm.

              <li>Identifies individuals who may be trapped or in need of assistance.</li>

            <Body className="mb-12">
              Fire safety is evolving from a compliance-led requirement to a data-led intelligence operation. By embracing real-time evacuation intelligence, building managers can move beyond the tick-box and provide a higher standard of protection for their occupants.
